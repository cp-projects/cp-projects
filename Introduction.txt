Hello, I am a university student trying to learn data science and ML. The main purpose of this GitHub is to practice and record my development in moving toward the goal of being able to express all of the ideas I've taken away from my math, economics, algorithm design, and statistics education, in unique and creative code. Real world problems are unique in that they are naturally complicated by the intricacies life and thinking creatively about old "solved" problems can be the most important aspect of creating the better solutions which move academic understanding forward or give businesses a competitive edge. Most of the code on here is made up of personal projects and likely (is not yet) very useful to others. This is because I believe above all else, that creative thinking in the sciences comes from profound understanding of a few fundamental concepts, so I want to build as much as possible myself rather than relying on existing frameworks and libraries which I could learn to use without fully understanding. The ethos of these projects is that if I can write it in C++ I can write it in python and if I can make my own Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Automata Generation, and Machine Learning libraries then I can learn to use the (probably better) libraries written by others. The hope is that in taking nothing for granted and doing as much as possible "from scratch" I can learn to see things I wouldn't otherwise notice, and become a more dynamic problem solver, programmer, and data scientist. 

  

If you are a more experienced programmer or data scientist with similar interests, I would love to hear any critiques or edits of my code! I understand I have a lot to learn and will be very appreciative and receptive to any advice you are kind enough to give me.
